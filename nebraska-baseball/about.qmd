Hi, my name is Haley Geringer and I’m a second year with senior standing from Bellevue, Nebraska. Currently I’m a double major studying sports media and communications and advertising and public relations with a minor in coaching at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln.  

As a full-time college student, I work two part-time jobs with other floater jobs here and there. One job is out in Omaha, it’s Goldfish Swim School where I am manager on duty (MOD) four days a week. I can do everything from teaching lessons to running the entire store (which I will say is nerve racking).  The other job is my on-campus job with HuskerVision where I am a camera operator for my designated sports. Since winter sports are over you can see me shooting ISO for Nebraska baseball. You can also see me as a peer mentor for the College of Journalism and Mass Communications and doing freelance photography on the side.  

The minute I tried a journalism class in middle school was when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in this field. Currently, the track I want to pursue is to be a Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) agent for student athletes in college. I know how difficult it is to be an athlete and still make money, so I believe being able to help athletes build brands for themselves is important today. Hopefully, I can get a job with the university to start that path, otherwise I have no idea what I’ll do.  

A little about myself, outside of school and work, I love spending time with my friends and family (especially three of my little brothers). Whenever I get the chance, I always go on a good Target run to debrief after a long day or go on a hot girl walk listening to my favorite music. I have a miniature schnauzer who lives with my grandparents named Bella who is the absolute sweetest.
