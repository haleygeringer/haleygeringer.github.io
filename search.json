    "text": "Hi, my name is Haley Geringer and I’m a second year with senior standing from Bellevue, Nebraska. Currently I’m a double major studying sports media and communications and advertising and public relations with a minor in coaching at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln.  \nAs a full-time college student, I work two part-time jobs with other floater jobs here and there. One job is out in Omaha, it’s Goldfish Swim School where I am manager on duty (MOD) four days a week. I can do everything from teaching lessons to running the entire store (which I will say is nerve racking).  The other job is my on-campus job with HuskerVision where I am a camera operator for my designated sports. Since winter sports are over you can see me shooting ISO for Nebraska baseball. You can also see me as a peer mentor for the College of Journalism and Mass Communications and doing freelance photography on the side.  \nThe minute I tried a journalism class in middle school was when I knew I wanted to pursue a career in this field. Currently, the track I want to pursue is to be a Name, Image and Likeness (NIL) agent for student athletes in college. I know how difficult it is to be an athlete and still make money, so I believe being able to help athletes build brands for themselves is important today. Hopefully, I can get a job with the university to start that path, otherwise I have no idea what I’ll do.  \nA little about myself, outside of school and work, I love spending time with my friends and family (especially three of my little brothers). Whenever I get the chance, I always go on a good Target run to debrief after a long day or go on a hot girl walk listening to my favorite music. I have a miniature schnauzer who lives with my grandparents named Bella who is the absolute sweetest."

    "text": "Looking at Big Ten baseball can be a little confusing since not every university has a baseball team, but that’s no the point. With the teams we do have, how can we tell which one is the best among the rest?\nFirst we can look and compare each teams pitching stats and how well they do on the mound. You have to keep in mind that pitchers have that added extra stress from the pitch clock that could affect how they perform.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ngames &lt;- read.csv(\"pitching.csv\")\n\ntotals &lt;- games |&gt; \n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    EarnedRuns = sum(ERA),\n    InningsPlayed = sum(IP)\n  ) \nnu &lt;- totals |&gt; filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=totals, aes(x=reorder(Team, EarnedRuns), weight=EarnedRuns), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nu, aes(x=reorder(Team, EarnedRuns), weight=EarnedRuns), color=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Earned Runs\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=totals, aes(x=reorder(Team, InningsPlayed), weight=InningsPlayed), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=nu, aes(x=reorder(Team, InningsPlayed), weight=InningsPlayed), color=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Innings Played\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\nbar1 + bar2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Earned Runs vs. Innings Played\",\n    subtitle = \"How does Nebraska pitching compare to the rest of the Big Ten.\",\n    caption = \"Source: bigten.org | By: Haley Geringer\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into the graphs you can tell where Nebraska does the best. Their average earned innings is the lowest in the Big Ten. That means they are less likely to let a batter walk or get a hit. Average innings played Nebraska stands in the middle. They aren’t the best, but they aren’t the worst.\n\n\nCode\nbatting &lt;- read_csv(\"battingstats.csv\")\n\nnu &lt;- batting |&gt; filter (Team ==\"Nebraska\")\nrt &lt;- batting |&gt; filter (Team ==\"Rutgers\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=batting, aes(x=AB, y=H)) +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=AB, y=H), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=rt, aes(x=AB, y=H), color=\"maroon\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"At Bats\", \n    y=\"Hits\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"At Bats vs. Actual Hits\",\n    subtitle = \"With Nebraska being number 5 for batting, \n    how do they compare to number one Rutgers.\",\n    caption = \"Source: bigten.org | By: Haley Geringer\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking into our hitting statistics they aren’t looking pretty. The red dot representing Nebraska is in the average area where most of the other dots are. Rutgers on the other hand, they are above Nebraska and every other team in the Big Ten. They lead the Big Ten in at bats and hits creating that big jump between teams. With that being said, Nebraska’s performance on the hitting side could use some work but it’s not the worst anyone has seen.\n\n\nCode\nfielding &lt;- read_csv(\"fieldingstats.csv\")\n\n\ndifference &lt;- fielding |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    PutOuts = sum(PO), \n    Errors = sum(E))\n \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=difference, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, Errors), x=PutOuts, xend=Errors),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Put Outs vs Errors in the Big Ten\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;PutOuts&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good. If &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Errors&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's bad.\",\n    caption = \"Source: bigten.org | By: Haley Geringer\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody wants to see a high percentage of errors in their fielding. Every team, including Nebraska, has roughly the same percentage of error in their fielding. That’s good! That means Nebraska is not doing terrible. Put outs on the other hand, that is in the middle closer to the lower end of that. They aren’t getting as many people out with fielding as they are with pitching, but their still getting people out so it evens out."
